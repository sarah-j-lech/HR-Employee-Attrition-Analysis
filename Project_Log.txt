PROJECT LOG: HR ATTRITION ANALYSIS
Analyst: [Your Name]
Start Date: Jan 26, 2026

--- DAY 1 Part 1 ---
1. Data Acquisition:
   - Downloaded "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance" from Kaggle.
   - Raw file contains 1,470 rows and 35 columns.

2. Initial Inspection:
   - Converted CSV to Excel Workbook (.xlsx) for editing.
   - Created "Data Dictionary" tab to map variables.

3. Data Quality Audit:
   - Target Variable identified: "Attrition" (Yes/No).
   - Redundant columns identified for deletion:
     * Over18 (Single value: "Y")
     * StandardHours (Single value: "80")
     * EmployeeCount (Single value: "1")

4. Next Steps:
   - Proceed to Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering (Day 2).

--- DAY 1 Part 2 ---
1. Data Cleaning:
   - Deleted zero-variance columns (EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours).
   - Confirmed 0 duplicates in the dataset.

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Created "Age Group" column using Nested IF formula to segment employees into Young Adult (<30), Mid-Career (<50), and Senior.
   - Created "Education Level" column using IFS formula to decode numeric values (1-5) into text descriptions.

3. Status:
   - Dataset is now "Analysis Ready."

--- DAY 1 Part 3 ---
1. Analysis (Pivot Tables):
   - Calculated Overall Attrition Rate: 16.1%.
   - Broke down attrition by Department: Research & Development had the highest attrition numbers.
   - Broke down attrition by Age Group: Mid-Career employees have the highest attrition	rates followed by Young Adults. Senior employees have the lowest rates.

2. Key Findings:
   - 16% turnover is the company benchmark.
   - Research & Development appears to have the highest turnover volume.
   - Young Adults appear to be the most at-risk demographic.

--- DAY 2 Part 1 ---
1. SQL Setup:
   - Installed DB Browser for SQLite.
   - Created database `HR_Database.db`.
   - Imported `employeedata.csv` successfully.

2. Queries Ran:
   - Performed basic SELECT statements to view data.
   - Filtered data using WHERE clause to isolate employees with Attrition = 'Yes'.

3. Skills Unlocked:
   - Basic SQL Syntax (SELECT, FROM, WHERE).

--- DAY 2 Part 2 ---
1. SQL Aggregation:
   - Learned COUNT(*) to calculate totals.
   - Used GROUP BY to segment data (similar to Excel Pivot Tables).
   - Used ORDER BY DESC to rank Job Roles by attrition volume.

2. Key Finding:
   - Confirmed via SQL that Laboratory Technician has the highest raw number of exits.

--- DAY 2 Part 3 ---
1. SQL Aggregation:
   - Learned COUNT(*) to calculate totals.
   - Used GROUP BY to segment data (similar to Excel Pivot Tables).
   - Used ORDER BY DESC to rank Job Roles by attrition volume.

2. Key Finding:
   - Confirmed via SQL that Laboratory Technicians have the highest raw number of exits.

--- DAY 2 Part 4 ---
1. SQL Analysis:
   - Calculated Average Monthly Income using AVG().
   - Compared Income of "Leavers" vs "Stayers" using GROUP BY.

2. Key Finding:
   - Identified a salary gap: Employees who leave earn approx. $4,787 vs $6,832 for those who stay. 
   - This suggests compensation is a primary driver of attrition.

--- DAY 2 Part 5 ---
1. SQL Logic:
   - Mastered the CASE WHEN statement (SQL version of Excel IF).
   - Created dynamic age segmentation in SQL.
   - Used SUM(CASE...) to calculate custom counts in a single query.

2. Weekly Review:
   - Data is cleaned and structured.
   - Key insights extracted:
     * Turnover is highest in Sales/Lab Tech roles.
     * Significant pay gap identified between leavers and stayers.
     * Young Adults are the highest risk demographic.

3. Next Phase: Data Visualization (Tableau Public).

--- DAY 3 Part 1 ---
1. Visualization Setup:
   - Installed Tableau Public on Mac.
   - Connected to `IBM_Attrition_Cleaned.xlsx`.

2. First Chart:
   - Created a basic Bar Chart showing Attrition counts to verify data connection.
   - Learned the "Blue (Dimension) vs. Green (Measure)" concept.
   - Published workbook to Tableau Public profile.

--- DAY 3 Part 2 ---
1. Visuals Created:
   - "Attrition Risk by Age Group": Stacked 100% Bar Chart.
   - "Department Analysis": Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart.

2. Techniques Learned:
   - Used "Quick Table Calculation" (% of Total) to visualize rates instead of raw counts.
   - Mastered "Compute Using" (Down vs. Across) for stacked bars.
   - Applied custom color palette (Gray for retention, Red for attrition) to focus attention.

--- DAY 3 Part 3 ---
1. Visuals Created:
   - "Salary Analysis": Side-by-side bar chart comparing Avg Income of Leavers vs. Stayers by Job Role.

2. Key Insight Visualized:
   - Confirmed the salary gap visually.
   - Managers and Research Directors have massive pay gaps between those who stay and those who leave.
   - Sales Representatives have low pay overall, contributing to their high turnover.

--- DAY 4 Part 1 ---
1. Dashboard Construction:
   - Assembled Age, Department, and Salary charts into a unified view.
   - Set fixed resolution (1366x768) for professional display.

2. Interactivity Added:
   - Enabled "Use as Filter" on the Department chart. 
   - Users can now click a specific department to see how Age and Salary risks change for that specific team.

3. Status:
   - Dashboard is functionally complete.
